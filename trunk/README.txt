Description
----------------

GoFish lets you double-right-click anywhere on the game world to fish,
and enhances sound effects while fishing.

Fishing mode can be toggled using a keybind or slash command, and is
automatically enabled while a fishing pole is equipped, or when mousing
over a fishing pool. Fishing mode is disabled if you enter combat or
unequip a fishing pole, or after 10 seconds of no fishing activity if
it was enabled via mouseover.

GoFish does not support lures or other skill-enhancing items, as these
are not neccessary or especially useful in Mists of Pandaria.


Usage
---------

Type "/gofish" or bind a key to toggle fishing mode manually. Options
to adjust fishing sound levels will be added in the near future. Other
options or additional features are not planned.

GoFish was inspired by Ammo's FishermansFriend. The click-casting code
borrows heavily from Torhal's Archy. Fish school name translations were
copied from Kagaro's GatherMate2.
